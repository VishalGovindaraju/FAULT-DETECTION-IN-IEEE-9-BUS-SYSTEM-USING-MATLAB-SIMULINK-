# FAULT-DETECTION-IN-IEEE-9-BUS-SYSTEM-USING-MATLAB-SIMULINK-
This project presents a fault detection methodology for the IEEE 9-bus system using MATLAB and Simulink. The IEEE 9-bus system is a well-established testbed for studying power system stability and fault analysis due to its complexity and interconnectivity
